# Sunday School Simplified — flipbook site

Online **flipbooks** (the primary product) plus optional downloadable **PDF packets**
for the *Sunday School Simplified* series from The Candler Foundry. One shared flipbook
**engine** powers every packet; each packet supplies only its own content and assets.

> **Working on this repo with a Cowork / AI session? START HERE.** This README is the
> canonical, up-to-date source of truth for the project. Read it in full before making
> any change — and **keep it current**: any push that changes the design, schema,
> workflow, or status must update this README in the *same push* (see "Keep this README
> current" below). (Cowork's own "memory" files, if present, auto-load into the session
> and live in Cowork's internal store — they are **not** in Dropbox and **not** in this
> repo, so do not go looking for them in the Dropbox folder.)

## The one rule that matters most: how code lands here

This repo is mirrored into a **cloud-synced Dropbox folder** where a live `.git` and
ordinary text writes are **unreliable** (writes get silently truncated; git metadata gets
corrupted). Therefore:

- **Keep this README current — treat it as part of the deliverable.** Whenever a change
  alters the design, the content schema, the workflow, or the project status/pending list,
  update `README.md` and include it in the **same commit** as the change. A push that
  leaves this README stale is an incomplete push. (This file is the only project state
  that survives across sessions in git; do not rely on external notes to carry it.)
- **GitHub `main` is the SOURCE OF TRUTH.** The Dropbox folder is a browse-only mirror —
  never trust or edit local copies; always fetch the current file from GitHub first.
- **Author every change in `/tmp`** (native filesystem), run `node --check` on any JS,
  then **push via the GitHub API** and **verify byte parity** afterward. Do not write code
  files directly into the Dropbox/OneDrive mount.
- **Cowork mounted-folder reads can corrupt BINARY files too** (July 2026: a healthy
  1632x560 PNG on Emily's C: drive repeatedly arrived truncated — same byte count,
  stream cut, no IEND). Before pushing any image that came through a mount, verify it:
  PNG must contain `IEND` and fully decode (`PIL Image.load()`); otherwise get the bytes
  another way (e.g. have Emily upload directly to GitHub) rather than pushing garbage.
- Push with the **Git Data API**: GET `git/ref/heads/main` -> read the base commit's tree ->
  POST `git/blobs` (base64) per file -> POST `git/trees` (with `base_tree`) -> POST
  `git/commits` -> PATCH `git/refs/heads/main`. (One commit can carry several files.)
- **Token:** a fine-grained PAT (Contents: Read & Write, this repo only) is at
  `C:\Users\esavant\Dropbox\Sunday School Simplified\.claude-git-token.txt`. Use it;
  **never echo or print the token value.**
- **Netlify auto-deploys** every push to `main` (site `sundayschoolsimplified`). Each
  packet is reachable at its clean URL `/<slug>/`. Only push a packet once it's built,
  verified, and approved — pushing makes it live immediately.

## Verify before you push

Render the changed pages and eyeball them before committing:

- Playwright chromium headless-shell in the work sandbox: `npm i playwright-core`, then
  `node node_modules/playwright-core/cli.js install chromium-headless-shell`. The shell
  needs `libXdamage.so.1`: `apt-get download libxdamage1`, `dpkg-deb -x` to a writable
  dir, run node with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<that dir>`.
- Serve the repo root (`python3 -m http.server`) and screenshot **every spread at two
  viewports** (e.g. 1536x816 and 1920x1080), plus interaction checks: scripture-card
  click must open the modal **without flipping the page**, tab clicks must jump to the
  right spread. Actually READ the screenshots — measure with `getBoundingClientRect`
  when something looks off; don't guess from theory.
- Beware CSS class-name collisions when adding chrome around StPageFlip (a `.vtitle`
  clash between spine and video card once bottom-anchored the spine text).

## What the site is

- **Series landing:** `index.html` — lists every packet (reads `packets/index.json`).
- **Shared engine:** `engine/render.js` (page builder + StPageFlip driver + binder
  chrome), `engine/styles.css` (design system), `engine/assets/fonts/` (licensed
  webfonts), `engine/assets/candler-foundry-mark-white.svg` (spine mark).
- **Packets:** `packets/<slug>/` — each self-contained (thin `index.html` shell +
  `content.js` + local `assets/` + optional PDF).

```

## Design system (current — "binder", blue, template-driven)

The flipbook sits inside a **binder frame** that fills the viewport (approved July 2026;
this supersedes both the 1970s road-trip design AND the earlier floating-book blue
layout — no top bar, no page indicator).

- **Binder frame:** navy **spine** on the left (red dash at top; "Sunday School
  Simplified" in white vertical type reading bottom-to-top, letter tops facing the
  pages; white Candler Foundry circle-mark at the bottom) · the two-page book ·
  **index tabs** on the right. Tabs = one small "Contents" tab, one numbered tab per
  lesson labeled with its abbreviated reference (`tabRef`, e.g. "Jer. 29"), and a small
  "Additional Resources" tab. Active tab is navy. Tabs are the primary navigation
  (plus arrow keys / edge arrows). No "page N of M" pill.
- **Download:** a fixed vertical red **ribbon** docked to the right viewport edge
  ("Download Printable Packet"), OUTSIDE the book so it never overlaps at any window
  size. The fit formula reserves nothing at the bottom: scale =
  min((vw-130)/(68+1632+96), (vh-24)/1056).
- **Palette:** navy `#0A274C`, powder blue `#CCE0F5`, smoky blue `#2F5972`, page
  `#FCFDFF`, card `#EAF3FC`; brand red **`#FB1616`** as small accents only.
- **Type:** **Thierry Leonie** (display numerals), **Mulish** (body; upsized ~10% vs the
  old layout for readability/accessibility — body 18-19px), **Hello-Handmade Sans**
  (handmade display: letter heading, TOC title, tab numerals, fallback lesson titles).
  Thierry + Hello-Handmade via `@font-face` from `engine/assets/fonts/`; Mulish + Font
  Awesome from CDN.
- **Page order:** cover (`assets/cover.png`, full-bleed, `data-density="hard"` so it
  flips like a stiff board) · **letter** (no eyebrow logo, no rhythm box) · **Contents**
  (lesson list + relocated **"rhythm of each lesson" 5-step strip** at the bottom) ·
  **two pages per lesson** · **Additional Resources** (all `optionalVideo`s live here —
  lesson pages carry NO optional-viewing bar) · **end page** (full Candler Foundry logo,
  tagline, candlerfoundry.org). **No back-cover image** (old road-trip `back.jpg` was
  dropped; a new blue-design back cover may return later).
- **Lesson page A:** fixed full-bleed **header slot 816x280** at top — per-lesson art
  (`headerImage`, export at **1632x560**, white background) or, when null, an
  engine-drawn header replicating the approved art style (powder circle + Thierry
  numeral + red sparks, Hello-Handmade title, Mulish reference). Then Opening Prayer
  card, Scripture card, video zone (video card centers in remaining space — no orphan
  gap). **Page B:** questions distributed evenly (space-evenly), Closing Prayer, footer
  ("<title> · Lesson NN of N", left-aligned, no Foundry stamp).
- **Scripture (NRSVUE):** the scripture card is a real `<button>` (this is what stops
  StPageFlip's click-to-flip from firing — divs flip the page, buttons/links don't).
  It opens the scrollable popout modal (`scriptureText` HTML) with "Open in Bible
  Gateway" (NRSVUE) and attribution. Closes on x, backdrop, or Esc.
- **Video:** Watch card is an illustrated SVG placeholder until `videoUrl` (Vimeo embed
  URL) is set, then an iframe.

## Content schema (`content.js`)

```
window.BBS_CONTENT = { meta, contentsIntro, lessons: [ ... ] }

meta   = { series, title, letter: { heading, paragraphs[], quotes[], paragraphs2[],
           rhythmTitle, steps[], paragraphs3[], grace, signName } }
         // rhythmTitle+steps now render on the CONTENTS page (bottom strip),
         // not in the letter.

lesson = { n, accent, reference, shortRef, title,
           tabRef,              // NEW: short label for the side tab, e.g. "Jer. 29"
           subtitle,            // exists but UNUSED — subtitles were removed globally
           openingPrayer, closingPrayer,
           scriptureRef, scriptureUrl,   // scriptureUrl uses version=NRSVUE
           scriptureText,       // HTML string shown in the popout modal
           videoTitle, videoSubtitle, videoUrl,   // videoUrl empty until Vimeo links exist
           optionalVideo,       // { title, subtitle, url } or null — renders on the
                                //   Additional Resources page, NOT on the lesson page
           headerImage,         // path or null (engine draws the replica header when null);
                                //   art spec: 1632x560 PNG, white bg, fills 816x280 slot
           questions: [ ... ] } // 5-6 strings
```

`scriptureText` markup: `<h4>` sub-reference headings, `<p>` prose, `<p class="poet">`
poetry (line breaks via `<br>`), `<p class="super">` superscriptions/section titles, and
`<span class="vn">N</span>` red superscript verse numbers.

To change **content**, edit `content.js`. To change the **look or behavior for all
packets**, edit `engine/render.js` / `engine/styles.css` once.

## Packet #1 — Beyond Bumper Stickers (status)

Six lessons, each recovering a famous verse's original context against its bumper-sticker
misuse: Jeremiah 29, Psalm 46, Genesis 1-2, Philippians 2 & 4, 2 Timothy 3 (+ Genesis 2),
1 Corinthians 13.

- **All six lessons' discussion questions are FINAL** (Emily's approved wording).
- **Scripture text is in place (NRSVUE)** and opens in the popout modal.
- **Cover** is Emily's current Canva cover (`assets/cover.png`, 1632x2112).
- **Binder design shipped** (July 2026) with all lessons using the engine-drawn header.

**Pending inputs from Emily:**
- **Vimeo `videoUrl`s** per lesson (a few weeks out; the 3-Minute Bible MP4s are ~408 MB,
  so they must embed from Vimeo, not self-host).
- **Header art** per lesson (1632x560, white bg). Lesson 1's new art exists at
  `C:\Temporary Sunday School Simplified\Beyond Bumper Stickers Header - Lesson 1.png`
  but every mount transfer arrived truncated (see binary-corruption warning above), so
  `headerImage` is `null` for now; the engine fallback closely replicates that art.
  Old `assets/headers/lesson-01.png` (previous design) is still in the repo but unused.
- **New back cover** in the blue design (optional — back page currently dropped).
- **PDF re-cut** (secondary product; see below).

## The PDF (secondary, print-friendly product)

The flipbook is the main product; the PDF is an optional printable download and is still
the **earlier design** — not yet rebuilt. Emily's spec for the rebuild: on each lesson,
instead of the full passage text, show **(1) a hyperlink to the exact Bible Gateway NRSVUE
passage and (2) a QR code to the same URL.** Keep it ink-light for home printers.

## Adding a new packet

1. `cp -r packets/beyond-bumper-stickers packets/<new-slug>`; replace `content.js`,
   `assets/`, and the PDF.
2. Add an entry to `packets/index.json`.
3. Push to `main`; Netlify redeploys and the packet appears at `/<new-slug>/`.

Engine files never change when adding a packet.

## Local development

Pure static — serve the repo root (`python -m http.server`) and open `/`.
